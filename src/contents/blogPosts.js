      I built this website using React and Tailwind CSS. 
      The design is inspired by a terminal interface, 
      which I find visually appealing and fitting for a tech portfolio. 
      The website is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. 
      I wanted to create a unique experience to express myself.
